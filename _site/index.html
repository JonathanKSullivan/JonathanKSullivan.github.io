<h2 id="-artificial-intellegence-engineering-projects"><a href="#ai"></a> Artificial Intellegence Engineering Projects</h2>
<p><strong>Artificial intelligence is the future of computer science and technology. Its 
impact will be almost immeasurable. The field is wide open today, with so much 
to learn, and so many ways to contribute. Global innovations in the field of 
artificial intelligence (AI) are going to redefine virtually every aspect of our
lives. By mastering AI skills I will play a critical role in helping determine 
how this incredible technology impacts our future.</strong></p>

<h3 id="facial-keypoint-detection">Facial Keypoint Detection</h3>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JonathanKSullivan/Facial-Keypoint-Detection/master/images/obamas_with_keypoints.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>In this project, I combined my knowledge of computer vision techniques and deep 
learning to build and end-to-end facial keypoint recognition system. Facial 
keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on any face and are 
used in many applications, from facial tracking to emotion recognition. My code 
is able to take in any image containing faces and identify the location of each 
face and their facial keypoints.</p>

<p>In this project, I learned to track faces in a video and identify facial 
expressions using Affectiva. As a fun visualization, I taged each face with an 
appropriate emoji next to it. I then turned this into a game where the player 
needs to mimic a random emoji displayed by the computer!</p>

<p>Used Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to build RNNs that can generate sequences 
based on input data - with a focus on two applications: With the first I used 
real market data in order to predict future Apple stock prices using an RNN 
model. The second one is trained on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s classic novel 
Sherlock Holmes and will generate wacky sentences based on it that may - or may 
not - become the next great Sherlock Holmes novel!</p>

<p>Used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to build a pipeline to process 
real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, my algorithm will 
identify an estimate of the canine’s breed. If supplied an image of a human, 
the code will identify the resembling dog breed.</p>

<p>Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification, I made 
important design decisions about the user experience for your app. My goal was 
to understand the challenges involved in piecing together a series of models 
designed to perform various tasks in a data processing pipeline. Each model has 
its strengths and weaknesses, and engineering a real-world application often 
involves solving many problems without a perfect answer. My imperfect solution 
will nonetheless create a fun user experience!</p>

<p>In this project, I used IBM Watson’s NLP Services to create a simple 
question-answering system. I first used the Discovery service to pre-process a 
document collection and extract relevant information. I used the Conversation 
service to build a natural language interface that can respond to questions.</p>

<p><img src="vui-alexa-skill-overview.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>In this project, I built a fully functional skill for Amazon’s Alexa that 
provides year-dated facts from AI History (or some other History of my 
choosing). Through the process, I got to use the Alexa Skills Kit (ASK) - a 
current state of the art API for building voice systems.</p>

<p>In this project, I built a system that can recognize words communicated using 
the American Sign Language (ASL). I was provided a preprocessed dataset of 
tracked hand and nose positions extracted from video. My goal was to train a set
of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) using part of this dataset to try and identify 
individual words from test sequences.</p>

<p>As an optional challenge, I am incorporating Statistical Language Models (SLMs) 
that capture the conditional probability of particular sequences of words 
occurring. This should help me you improve the recognition accuracy of my 
system.</p>

<p><img src="pacman.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>In this project, my Pacman agent found paths through his maze world, both to 
reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. I built general 
search algorithms, such as breadth first search, depth first search, Uniform 
Cost Search, Astar Search and applied them to Pacman scenarios, such as finding 
corners and eating all of the food.</p>

<h3 id="air-cargo-transport-system-using-a-planning-search">Air Cargo transport system using a planning search</h3>
<p><img src="progression.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>In this project, I defined a group of problems in classical PDDL 
(Planning Domain Definition Language) for the air cargo domain. I then set up 
the problems for search, experimented with various automatically generated 
heuristics, including planning graph heuristics, to solve the problems, and then
provided an analysis of the results. Additionally, I wrote a short research 
review paper on the historical development of planning techniques and their use 
in artificial intelligence.</p>

<h3 id="isolation-game-playing-agent">Isolation Game-playing Agent</h3>
<p><img src="isolate.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>In this project, I developed an adversarial search agent to play the game 
“Isolation”. Isolation is a deterministic, two-player game of perfect 
information in which the players alternate turns moving a single piece from one 
cell to another on a board. Whenever either player occupies a cell, that cell 
becomes blocked for the remainder of the game. The first player with no 
remaining legal moves loses, and the opponent is declared the winner. These 
rules are implemented in the isolation.Board class provided in the repository.</p>

<p>This project uses a version of Isolation where each agent is restricted to 
L-shaped movements (like a knight in chess) on a rectangular grid (like a chess 
or checkerboard). The agents can move to any open cell on the board that is 
2-rows and 1-column or 2-columns and 1-row away from their current position on 
the board. Movements are blocked at the edges of the board (the board does not 
wrap around), however, the player can “jump” blocked or occupied spaces (just 
like a knight in chess).</p>

<p>Additionally, agents will have a fixed time limit each turn to search for the 
best move and respond. If the time limit expires during a player’s turn, that 
player forfeits the match, and the opponent wins.</p>

<p>I modified code in the game_agent.py file to complete the project. Additional 
files include example Player and evaluation functions, the game board class, and
a template to develop local unit tests.</p>

<p>My analysis concludes with a comparison of different heuristics and my reasoning
for choosing the heuristic I ultimately used in my agent.</p>

<p>The second part of this project I read a seminal paper(Game Tree Searching by 
Min / Max Approximation by Ron Rivest, MIT) in the field of Game-Playing and 
wrote a simple one page summary on it.</p>

<p><img src="https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/January/58846697_sudoku1/sudoku1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>In this project, I wrote code to implement two extensions of a sudoku solver. 
The first one implements the technique called “naked twins”. The second one 
modifies existing code to solve a diagonal sudoku. My goals were to implement 
the naked twins function and write an AI agent that solves the Diagonal Sudoku 
game.</p>

<h1 id="about-me"><a href="#about"></a>About Me</h1>

<p>Hello, my name is Jonathan Sullivan and welcome to my portfolio site. Below you 
will have a chance to learn more about me and see some of my work that I have 
done. I am very interested in Math and Computer Science. My latest work has been
in the areas of Artificial Intellegence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. 
However I also love to build web and iOS apps. We as a society are athe the next
major turning point in technology. We are leaving the digital age and entering 
the age of data and Machine Intellegence. My goals is to contribute to the next
wave of technology that change the world for the better.</p>

<h3 id="udacity">Udacity</h3>
<p><img src="udacity.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>My recent educational experience has been with a company, that I love. Udacity 
provide free class in programming and software engineering and paid Nanodegrees 
that focus on various fields. As a millenial new college grad living with his 
supportive parents. I started to spend 8-10 hours on this site daily. I was so 
amazed at the amount of material in so many fields of software engineering. This
was also my first time using python, Java my language of choice at the time. I 
used these resources to learn how to build iphone apps, and website apps. I also
learned skill in data science like Data Wrangling, Exploratory Data Analysis, 
Data Visualization, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Artificial Intellegence.</p>

<h3 id="university-of-north-texas-unt">University of North Texas (UNT)</h3>
<p><img src="unt.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>After leaving DCCCD were I had taken all possible math, Natural Science and 
computer engineering availible, I entered the university of North Texas. Here I 
majored in math and was pursuing a minor in Computer Engineering, Physics, 
Biology and Chemistry. Funny Story, my parent’s who paid my tutition, told me a 
semster before I took my last group of Physics, Biology and Chemistry, that If I
had the credit to graduate and didnt they didnt know how I was going to pay for 
it. So I ended up graduating with a major in math and a minor in computer 
science.</p>

<h3 id="dallas-county-community-college-dcccd">Dallas County Community College (DCCCD)</h3>
<p><img src="dcccd.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The next step into futhering my technical experience took place almost 5 years
later. At this time I also was a single father of a beutiful 4 years old little 
girl and a unborn son. While being a parent came with it on set of challenges, I
had a support network which allowed me to enroll in Dallas County Community
College District (DCCCD). I started to fall inlove with math. Not just because 
of the enthusiastic proffesor at DCCCD but also because of a man named Sal Khan 
and his organization Khan academy. This site allowed me to grab a firm understanding 
of advanded mathematics like Linear Algebra, Vector Calculus, and Differential 
Equations I started majoring in Computer Engineering but part way through I was 
convinced by my Differential Eqautions teacher to become a Math major.</p>

<h3 id="school-of-science-and-engineering-at-yvonne-a-ewell-magnet-center-sem">School of Science and Engineering at Yvonne A. Ewell Magnet Center (SEM)</h3>
<p><img src="sem.php" alt="" /></p>

<p>I have always had an intellectual curiosity especially when it comes to science.
I would say that my first relevant educational experience began in High School.
I was fortunate to go <a href="&quot;https://www.usnews.com/education/best-high-schools/
texas/districts/dallas-independent-school-district/
school-of-science-and-engineering-18934&quot;">School of Science and Engineering at Yvonne A Ewell 
Townview Magnet Center</a>. The school has been named among the 
highest-performing high schools in the country according to national \
publications’ rankings (U. S. News &amp; World Report, Newsweek, Washington Post).
In fact, when I graduated after attending school there for 3 years, we were 
ranked the number 1 school in the nation. In that same ,year the school was 
named a National Blue Ribbon School of Excellence by the United States 
Department of Education. Upon Graduation I had taken and made a score of ‘5’ on 
both the ‘AP Biology’ and ‘AP Computer Science A’. I also had taken a 
College Physics and General Chemistry course, allowing me to enter college at 16
with sophmore credits.</p>
